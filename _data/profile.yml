  <p>I am currently an Associate Professor with the <a  href="https://vcc.tech/"> VCC group</a> at Shenzhen University. Before joining SZU, I worked with Prof. <a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/~taicl">Chiew-Lan Tai</a> as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I also obtained my Ph.D in Computer Science in 2015, under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/~taicl">Chiew-Lan Tai</a> and Prof. <a href="https://hongbofu.people.ust.hk/">Hongbo Fu</a>. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2009. My research falls in Computer Graphics and Human-Computer Interaction, especially automatic/interactive 2D and 3D content creation.
